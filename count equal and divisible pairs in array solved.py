class Solution(object):
    def countPairs(self, nums, k):
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] == nums[j] and i*j%k ==0:
                    count+=1
        return count
    
Input: nums = [3,1,2,2,2,1,3], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation:
There are 4 pairs that meet all the requirements:
- nums[0] == nums[6], and 0 * 6 == 0, which is divisible by 2.
- nums[2] == nums[3], and 2 * 3 == 6, which is divisible by 2.
- nums[2] == nums[4], and 2 * 4 == 8, which is divisible by 2.
- nums[3] == nums[4], and 3 * 4 == 12, which is divisible by 2.
